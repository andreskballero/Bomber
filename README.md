Atari2600-Bomber Game

bomber.asm assembled using the DASM assembler (https://dasm-assembler.github.io), running on terminal the following command: *dasm \*.asm -f3 -v0 -ocart.bin*

To execute the resulting ROM cartridge, the Stella Emulator (https://stella-emu.github.io) was used. The game was programmed using the NTSC TV formatting convention, so in the Stella Emulator, for it to work properly, the cartridge must be selected and then go to Options -> Game Properties, and in the TV format section, select NTSC.

How to play: - Use the keys "left arrow", "right arrow", "up arrow" and "down arrow" to move the jet - Press "space" to launch a missile - Try to hit with a missile as many bombers as possible without the jet being hit by any of them
